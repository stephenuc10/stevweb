        <p>Pennsylvania criminalizes many activities related to child pornography through its sexual abuse laws. State law prohibits the photographing, filming, and videotaping of a sexual act involving a child under the age of 18, regardless of whether the sexual act is real or simulated Transmit, distribute, or share an electronic communication (such as a text message, instant message, email) containing a nude image of him or herself or any other person age 12 or older, but younger than 18, or. Possess a nude photo of another person between the ages of 12 and 17
           Pennsylvania law prohibits indecent exposure, open lewdness, and disorderly conduct. These are all somewhat related and often overlap. While disorderly conduct is a summary offense, indecent exposure and open lewdness are misdemeanors (each with the possibility of incarceration). 
        
           <span class="italics"> likened sending unrequested nude </span> photos and other explicit images through email, text, and/or social media platforms to exposing oneself in public to strangers, which is referred to as indecent exposure. This offense is a Class B misdemeanor and is punished by up to 180 days in jail and up to $2,000 in fines The penalties for a conviction include up to 5 years in prison and up to $25,000 in fines. This level and class of offense can also be levied against you if you possessed an explicit image of a minor and you were previously convicted of this or a similar crime. However, the fine is a maximum of $7,500.
           The answer is that while state laws vary, in most states to be guilty of exposure, lewdness, or other crimes that involve being viewed in the nude, the location need only be visible to the public. So, even if you are on your own property, you can still be arrested if others can see you. Sending pictures of anyone without their consent could fall under California's revenge porn law. You could be charged with unlawful distribution and harassment. Each of these charges could result in jail time and fines. that's all about porno law.
